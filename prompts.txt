Apparently when I input a number in the change it will only trigger the button to be unclickable, so when the cart is rendered there's no number in the input, the button is clickable. Is there a way to instead declare or automatically put a number inside the input or change the condition that triggers this so it's unclickable already right when the cart is rendered
