NEW STEP

Added the simple routing of dashboard cards on the top but I am still thinking about the security of Recent Orders, Low Stocks Products and others..

But I am thinking about the top 4 cards visibility too, but not as high as requiring a password, but at least just a button to click just so the data doesn't sit there exposing itself in the admin's screen without protection
